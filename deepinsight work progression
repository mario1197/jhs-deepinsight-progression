I created video which shows the head pose of human and save the angle of the sensor.

When we run videocap.py file,if we click the ctrl+x button, then we start recording of the head pose and recording the angle of the sensor cuncurrently. 

Video shows the head pose of the human as arrowline. 

We can terminate the record by clicking x button(not ctrl+x).

When we finish the record, then the code automatically saves the video of human and the angle of the sensor.

--> next... what?
maybe we have to compare the sensor angle and the head pose angle.
